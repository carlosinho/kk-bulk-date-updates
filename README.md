## WordPress Coding Standards

This plugin follows WordPress coding standards and best practices:

- **Security**: Proper nonce verification, capability checks, and data sanitization
- **Database**: Uses WordPress database abstraction layer (`$wpdb`) with prepared statements
- **Hooks**: Utilizes WordPress action and filter hooks for extensibility
- **Internationalization**: All strings are translatable using `__()` and `_e()` functions
- **Asset Management**: Proper enqueueing of scripts and styles
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries, batch processing, and memory management

## Development

### Key Classes and Functions

#### Main Plugin Class: `KK_Bulk_Date_Updates`
- Singleton pattern implementation
- Handles plugin lifecycle (activation, deactivation, uninstall)
- Manages admin interface and AJAX handlers
- Enqueues scripts and styles

#### Admin Interface
- Located in `includes/admin/admin-page.php`
- Provides comprehensive form for bulk date updates with content filtering
- Includes JavaScript for dynamic form behavior and filter management

#### Content Filtering System
The plugin implements a sophisticated filtering system to target specific content:

- **Filter Types**: Date range, count limit, and taxonomy filtering
- **Smart UI**: Dynamic show/hide of filter options based on selection
- **Taxonomy Detection**: Automatically shows/hides categories/tags based on selected post types
- **Query Integration**: Filters are applied at the database level using `WP_Query` arguments
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering with minimal database overhead

#### Core Functions
- `get_posts_to_update()`: Central function that applies all filters and returns target post IDs
- `sanitize_form_data()`: Handles sanitization of all form inputs including filter data
- `validate_form_data()`: Validates filter-specific requirements and constraints

#### Admin CSS Classes
- `kk-bulk-date-updates-admin`: Main admin container
- `kk-bulk-date-updates-form`: Form styling
- `kk-bulk-date-updates-button`: Button styling
- `kk-bulk-date-updates-message`: Message notifications
- `kk-bulk-date-updates-progress`: Progress indicators

### Extending the Plugin

The plugin is designed to be extensible through WordPress hooks. Here are some examples:

```php
// Filter the WP_Query arguments before getting posts to update
add_filter('kk_bulk_date_updates_query_args', function($args, $form_data) {
    // Add custom meta query
    $args['meta_query'] = array(
        array(
            'key' => 'featured_post',
            'value' => '1',
            'compare' => '='
        )
    );
    return $args;
}, 10, 2);

// Modify available content filter options
add_filter('kk_bulk_date_updates_content_filters', function($filters) {
    $filters['custom_filter'] = 'Custom Filter Type';
    return $filters;
});

// Add custom validation for content filters
add_filter('kk_bulk_date_updates_validate_filters', function($is_valid, $filter_type, $form_data) {
    if ($filter_type === 'custom_filter') {
        // Add custom validation logic
        return !empty($form_data['custom_field']);
    }
    return $is_valid;
}, 10, 3);
```

## Security Considerations

- All AJAX requests are protected with nonces
- User capability checks (`manage_options`) are enforced
- Input data is properly sanitized and validated
- SQL queries use prepared statements
- Direct file access is prevented

## Performance

- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Batch processing for large datasets (handles 1000+ posts)
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Optimized asset loading (only on relevant admin pages)
- Memory management for large operations (requires 512MB+ for 1000+ posts)

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
